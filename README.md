###By [Avalith Development & Design](http://avalith.com)

We built this tool to solve a problem:  we talk about responsive web design a lot, and needed a (nerdy) tool & visual aid to quickly and easily demonstrate.

You can easily see how your site will look on any given mobile device.  You _could_ go buy every tablet and phone out there, but we figured this was cheaper.
